# Funky Dragon

This is a university project. The assignment was to create an interactive animation with sound using HTML5 and CSS3 (and JS for Canvas stuff).

I kinda went overboard and the animation turned into a game. I've been focucing on JS and HTML Canvas elements.

Preview the game here - https://shushuda.github.io/funky-dragon-2/
